//~ * Map * ~

//TODO Together: Let's see a common approach we might have done in the past: our goal is to increase each element of an array by 1 [element + 1], then get an array back with those values

// var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
// var numbersAddOne = [];
// for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 1) {
//     if (numbersAddOne[i] + 1) {
//         numbersAddOne.push(numbers[i]);
//     }
// }
// console.log(numbersAddOne); // [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

//TODO Together: Now, let's achieve the same result with the first part of our lesson: the MAP method~
// const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
// let numbersAddOneMap = numbers.map(num=> num +1)
// console.log(numbersAddOneMap)

const favoriteRestaurants =[{
    name: 'Wing Stop',
    address: '1464 Austin Hwy #103',
    phone: ' (210) 828-9464',
    restaurantFeatures: ['Lemon Pepper Hot', 'To-Go']
},
    {
       name: 'MOD Pizza',
       address: '8134 Agora Pkwy Suite 250',
        phone: '(210) 566-4560',
        restaurantFeatures: ['custom pizza', 'brick-oven cooked']
    }
]
//TODO Together: Let's get all these restaurant names out of this array of objects with .map()!

let nameList = favoriteRestaurants.map(restaurant => restaurant.name)


//TODO: Create your own array of (up to 3 and at least 2) restaurant objects building off of the basic list you created during the MapBox exercise (or build one anew!) ~5 mins

//TODO: Now, having created a personal array of restaurant objects for yourself, use .map() to get your favorite restaurant's names out of that collection, into another array, and out into the console! ~5 mins
let names = favoriteRestaurants.map(restaurant=> restaurant.name)

let nameAndAddress = favoriteRestaurants.map(restaurants => `${restaurants.name}, ${restaurants.address}`)
console.log(names);
console.log(nameAndAddress)
//~ * Filter * ~

//TODO Together: Once again, let's take a look at the old way we might approach an issue: getting only one type of values out of an array (for example: even numbers only from an array of nums!)
// var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
// var evens = [];
// for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 1) {
//     if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
//         evens.push(numbers[i]);
//     }
// }
// console.log(evens); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
//TODO Together: Now, let's refactor the above using the ES6 .filter() method with the same goal: even numbers only!
// let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
//
// let evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2===0)
// console.log(evens);

//TODO Together: Using my favoriteRestaurants list, let's filter out all of the non-buffet restaurants

// let buffetRestautants = favoriteRestaurants.filter( =>restaurant.restaurantFeatures.includes(‘buffet’) )

//TODO: Each one of your restaurant arrays is unique, but, in that array, identify something to filter by - it could be as simple as "well, let me filter out all of the restaurants with names shorter than 8 characters" or get as complicated as you'd like!

//restaurants that includes 'To-Go'

//TODO: Once you've done the above, go ahead and write the necessary code to achieve what you wanted - remember to practice with .filter() and our ES6 verbiage!
let filterRestaurantFeatures = favoriteRestaurants.filter(restaurant=> restaurant.restaurantFeatures.includes('To-Go')  )
console.log(filterRestaurantFeatures)
//~ * Reduce * ~

//Reduce is an interesting animal in and of itself: it's a way to reduce a collection down to, typically, a single value of some kind:

//TODO Together: Let's sum up some numbers with the .reduce() method and a number array!
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
let sum = numbers.reduce((total, num)=>{
    return total + num;
},0)

//TODO Together: Let's take a step a bit deeper with .reduce() - .reduce()'s output can take many forms and shapes. For example, let's say we wanted to have a little Javascript that would count the length of the strings in an array and return that info back to us in an object. For example: ["Codeup", "San" "Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco" "Cohort", "ES6"] would get us: Object { Codeup: 6, San: 3, Antonio: 7, Dallas: 6, Marco: 5, Cohort: 6, ES6: 3 }
let stringArr = ["Codeup", "San", "Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco", "Cohort", "ES6"];
let strLengthObj = stringArr.reduce((object,element)=>{
     object[element] = element.length; // assign the length as a value of the property named element {elementLength}
    return object
},{})
console.log(strLengthObj)
//TODO Together: That's pretty wild, eh! Wonder what else we could get up to with .reduce() - how about we make a function and use .reduce() inside of it? We'll write a function named countWords that takes a sentence in a single string. We need to split that sentence into an array and then write a .reduce() that would let us know how many times each word appeared in the string.

// function countWords(sentence) {
//     const words = sentence.split(' '); // transform a sentence into an array of words
//     const wordCountObject = words.reduce((wordCounts, word) => {
//         if (typeof wordCounts[word] === 'undefined') {
//             // if the word is not yet present in our object, set it's value to 1
//             wordCounts[word] = 1;
//         } else {
//             // otherwise increment the existing count
//             wordCounts[word] += 1;
//         }
//         return wordCounts;
//     }, {}); // start with an empty object
//     return wordCountObject;
// }


//TODO Together: Pretty good, but do we want to count the number of times the comma is involved? If only we had a method that would .filter() - wait! Let's refactor the above function to do just that!
function countWords(sentence) {
    let words = sentence.split(' '); // transform a sentence into an array of words

    words = words.filter((word) => (word !== ","));

    const wordCountObject = words.reduce((wordCounts, word) => {
        if (typeof wordCounts[word] === 'undefined') {
            // if the word is not yet present in our object, set it's value to 1
            wordCounts[word] = 1;
        } else {
            // otherwise increment the existing count
            wordCounts[word] += 1;
        }
        return wordCounts;
    }, {}); // start with an empty object
    return wordCountObject;
}


console.log(countWords);
//TODO: Let's make a new array of objects to use - make an array of objects [{},{},{}] consisting of a number of family members as objects with their name and ages as properties. Use .reduce() to sum up the age of those family members and see what it is! e.g. [{name: "Thurston Howell III", age: 50}, {name: "William Dean Howells", age: 83}] would be 133 by adding those two age properties together (50 + 83).

let family= [{
    name: "Aalyiah Patterson",
    age:22,
},
    {
        name: 'Tyewaune Patterson',
        age: 27

    },
    {
        name: 'Todd Patteson',
        age: 50
    },
    {
        name: 'Monique Patterson',
        age: 50
    },
    {
        name: "Amirah Beal",
        age: 22
    },
    {
        name: 'Ashea Inman',
        age: 24
    }
    ]

let sumOfAges = family.reduce((total, person)=>{
    return total + person.age
},0)
console.log(sumOfAges)
